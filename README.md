### [WIP] 

"<i>Heads Up</i>" displays your upcoming events and to-do list, importing them directly from your Outlook or Google Account. 
Heads Up is designed for use on a designated display, adding both function and atmosphere to your workspace or wall.

I made Heads Up to help me stay motivated despite an unrelenting Academic and Social calendar.

### FUTURE:
- Integrate optional motion/ light detection
- Sleep Screen
- Night-light mode
